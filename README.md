# Building a Publication-Ready Dataset from CAMP

[Paulson et al. JPC (2022)](ihttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231127) created machine learning models using data from different types of cells made by the [CAMP Facility](https://www.anl.gov/cse/cell-analysis-modeling-and-prototyping-camp-facility).
We convert that data into publication-ready forms in this repository by storing the data in well-defined formats that package metadata about the cell's design and testing.

See [our battery data toolkit](https://github.com/materials-data-facility/battery-data-toolkit) for a full description on the tools for how to use it.

## Installation

TBD for now, as Logan will publish battery data toolkit to PyPi after we have it ready to make data.
